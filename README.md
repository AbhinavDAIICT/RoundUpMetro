# Welcome

RoundUpMetro holds the code for my upcoming website roundupnow.com
It is based on the Metro UI CSS (http://metroui.org.ua)
The website emulates Windows 8 start screen and aims to provide users with clutter free news. The website will display only the top ten news items from all across the web at anytime. This is an ongoing project. Twitter data will be used to determine the top news items and we might require NLP to reject duplicate items.
